## ðŸŒˆAbout

The aim of this app is to provide the user with all of their color-picking needs on the go. All it takes to get started is simply uploading a photo from your mobile device's camera roll.  From there you'll be able to pick and save colors directly from your own photos! Save your favorite colors, design your own palettes, generate complex harmonies, and even edit colors!
