    <string name="daniel_blurb">I love AI and automation, so naturally I chose to help with UI on a
                                color picking app. I very much enjoy developing with friends, even
                                if it\'s outside of my comfort zone. My favorite color in the app is
                                called \"Jedi Night,\" a deep dark green.</string>
